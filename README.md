# News Site

I'm making a news site to keep you updated on what happens in the world of coding for children. 

## The problem

OMG, Flexbox... ! I've watched the study material with Jennie and Annika several times. Rewatched the lessons with Van and Max several times. I tried one tutorial - didn't get the wanted result. Deleted it. Tried again. Still didn't work, but not the same result as last time. Tried another totorial, still didn't work. Tweaked it - and fixed it! Just wanted to cry! Next up - Flexbox children in Flexbox child. Took me DAYS, but went from "I'm never going to finish my project." to "This is fairly easy". You guys are wizards! If I would have had more time, i would have finished the content, articles, footer and styling!

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
